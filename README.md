# Some ideas for it's development, star it if you want to see development/contribute with ideas

1) Wrap around an API of a popular exchange (kraken, coinbase,.. etc). NLP processing most likely, or bottleneck information.

2) Using mined data to output actions (e.g, buy/sell). Tecnical analysis should be added as aswell, such as pre-processing heiken-ashi charts.

3) Develop a Twitter API for sentiment analysis/implement complex models of predictions in order to increase performance
